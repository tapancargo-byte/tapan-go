# CodeRabbit Global Review

This PR exists only to trigger a **CodeRabbit full review** of the current `main` branch.

- Please review the entire repository structure, not just this file.
- Focus on auth/security, API routes, Supabase usage, Sentry integration, and performance hotspots.
- Suggest concrete refactors and risk areas to prioritize.
